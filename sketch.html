        Sketch</h2>
      <p>
       1. You need a common paper. In the sketching you don’t need a thick paper instead you can use the paper for print or a sheet of a notebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. The first tip that you may have in count is that every part of an element or person have shapes. For example, if you want draw an arm you must have the idea that are two rectangles connected to a circle and the hand is a square with five rectangles.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. When you are sketching is very important don’t take the pencil with a big pressure when you are doing a circle. The correct way is draw softy and if you want to do a circle, the way is draw little lines for get the circle. This give you the control of the drawing and precision.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. If you don’t like the pencil for sketching, you can also use colored pencils or pens for your sketching to be more colorful (if you want with more details your sketching, you can remark the sketch with a pencil, mechanical pencil, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       5. One exercise can be draw figure like circles , rectangles, etc.
